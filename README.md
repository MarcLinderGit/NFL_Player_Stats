# Web scraping 2023 NFL player stats using Beautiful Soup

This Jupyter notebook presents a Python web scraping project that extracts NFL player statistics data from the official [NFL website](https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats) for the 2023 regular season. The code demonstrates how to scrape data for various player statistics categories, such as passing, rushing, receiving, fumbles, tackles, interceptions, field goals, kickoffs, kickoff returns, punting, and punt returns.

## Key Components

1. **Environment Setup**: Setting up the environment and importing necessary libraries.
2. **Data Sources**: Defining the base URL and the current week of the NFL season.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Retrieving the URLs for different player statistics categories.
4. **Web Scraping**: Iteratively scraping data from multiple pages for each category, handling pagination.
5. **Data Storage**: Storing the scraped data for further analysis.

This project provides a comprehensive example of web scraping using Python, BeautifulSoup, and requests, showcasing how to navigate through web pages, extract data, and organize it for analysis. You can adapt this code to scrape other sports statistics or websites of interest.
